This repository hosts the code for my ongoing explorations of decision-making, rationality and evidence accumulation in large language models. I'm currently focusing on "llama-3b-Instruct," subjecting it to a neuroscience-inspired behavioral experiments ("text based psychopysics"). This approach aims to extrapolate and better understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying decision-making processes in these artificail cognitive systems.

TODO:
- continue exploring and run longer to sample better
- compare with reference bayesian model
- exploit properly the "next" option
- try to decode uncertainty/confidence pressure-to-perform from FC layer and relate to same variables in natural language tasks
